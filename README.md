# FruitClassification
## This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Model created using Python.
## The project aims to classify fruits and vegetables images into 36 classes :
The CNN model is trained on a dataset of over 2800 images of fruits and achieves an accuracy of 90% on the validation set

Our Model is implemented based on this research paper : https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-49342-4_9 

We applied the same Algorithm but on a different dataset

## Used Libaries 
numpy ,sklearn -> preprocessing 
Tensorflow keras openCV2
seaborn -> Data Visualization
